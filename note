this will allow each commit to be saved by users email and user name (they can be anything and everything)
git branch <name_of_branch> 
will add a new branch
output :
* master
  yassine
git checkout <name_of_branch> : allow you to checkout from the current branch and go to the one desired 
output:
M	note
Switched to branch '<name_of_branch>'

git log : allows you check your commit logs in full details
